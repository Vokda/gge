\part{GGE in short}
GGE stands for Grid Game Engine (very creative, I know). It is inteded to be used as a game engine for grid based games such as chess or Sid Meier's Civilization. It is not only restricted to turn based games.

The engine itself is written in C++ and depends on SDL2. Games for the engine are written in Guile, a variant of lisp.

There are tools for generating code written in Perl5 though they are not necessary for using the engine.

The following two parts will cover the inner and outer workings of the engine.

The inner working of the engine is not strictly necessary to know when writing a game but it may help understand what happens under the hood. 
This part should be helpful in case of modifying the engine or adding custom game engine modules.

The outer working of the engine is the (Guile) scripting part of it. This is necessary for understanding the process of making a game.
It will also thuroughly describe the example "game" provided.
